          Through my courses at GIMM, I have learned:
            <li>Design patterns</li>
            <li>Programming language comprehension skills</li>
            <li>Application of new technologies</li>
        </ul>

      <strong>GIMM 100:</strong>
      <br>
      An animation class where I learned the basics of storyboarding, animation techniques, and Adobe programs including Photoshop and Animate.
      <br>
      <img src="images/Storyboard1.png" width="500" height="300">
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 110:</strong>
      <br>
      A game design class were we started learning how to design basic games, especially using "Flash games" with Adobe Animate and javascript.
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 200:</strong>
      <br>
      A follow up to GIMM 100, where we continued developing our animation techniques, and finished our music video projects.
      <br>

      <br>
      I had no animation skill before these two classes, so please pardon the simple design, and lack of walking animation in the middle.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 250:</strong>
      <br>
      A continuation of skill building in animation and interactive media using Adobe Animate and javascript.
      <br>

      <strong>GIMM 270:</strong>
      <br>
      This class taught us how to do basic video editing in Adobe Premiere.
      <br>
      Topics included greenscreening, stitching, and 360 video.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 280:</strong>
      <br>
      280 was a class where we learned about mechanical electronics, how to use motors and electrical switches.
      <br>
      We also had some projects that were able to be connected to the computer and controled with digital input.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 290:</strong>
      <br>
      290 taught us better ways to structure game design, and how to plan out a large-scale game project.
      <br>
      We also leared skills with the Unity 3D program, and how to code in C# for Unity.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 300:</strong>
      <br>
      300 is our web design class.  We overviewed HTML programming, as well as CSS and javascript for web design.
      <br>
      This site is a project for this class.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 310:</strong>
      <br>
      310 is a mobile app design class.  Our class group was the first to work exclusively with iOS.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 330:</strong>
      <br>
      330 taught us techniques for designing 3D models.  We used Maya from AutoDesk to create a low-poly model and apply basic animation to it.
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 350:</strong>
      <br>
      350 was an advanced game design class, with more advanced skills in the Unity engine, and technical aspects of game design.
      <br>
      We learned how to create states for individual levels or stages, multiplayer functionality over a network, and how to implement Oculus Rift controls into our projects.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 360:</strong>
      <br>
      This class was all about editing audio and manipulating sound files.
      <br>
      We used a program called VCV Rack, which emulates a synthesizer.
      <br>
      I must admit, I had difficulty using this program, and do not have any projects I consider worthwhile to show.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 370:</strong>
      <br>
      This class is a continuation of 330, with more advanced modeling techniques.
      <br>
      The end goal for this class is to create a high-poly model with much better levels of detail.

      <strong>Personal Projects:</strong>
      <br>
      On my own time, I enjoy learning how to develop my skills with design programs.
      <br>
      In a short amount of time, I learned how to remove unwanted color or backgrounds fom animated images, and / or how to create animated images myself.
      <br>
      Here is a personal project where I removed the white space from this animated .gif of a Snorlax:
      <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
          <th>Original:</th>
          <th>My edit:</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="images/SnorlaxSleeping.gif"></td>
          <td><img src="images/SnorlaxSleepingClr.gif"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      I have also learned how to merge images together to create new projects out of other source materials.
      <br>
      Here I placed the Pok√©mon Slowbro into a "Koopa Clown Car" using a manga render and an alternate fanart of the Koopaling Wendy, (because I wanted the pink car):
      <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
          <th>Sources:</th>
          <th>My edit:</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="images/Jinga_Slowbro.png"><img src="images/Wendy_tumblr_inline_nko8itu4251rycdb5.png"></td>
          <td><img src="images/SlowbroKoopaCar.png"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      (This project took me a much longer time to accomplish.)
