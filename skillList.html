      <strong>GIMM 100:</strong>
      <br>
      An animation class where I learned the basics of storyboarding, animation techniques, and Adobe programs including Photoshop and Animate.
      <br>
      <img src="images/Storyboard1.png" width="500" height="300">
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 110:</strong>
      <br>
      A game design class were we started learning how to design basic games, especially using "Flash games" with Adobe Animate and javascript.
      <br>
      <embed width="1000" height="600" src="video/Shoot.swf">
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 200:</strong>
      <br>
      A follow up to GIMM 100, where we continued developing our animation techniques, and finished our music video projects.
      <br>

      <br>
      This was my first animation, and I'm pleased with how well it turned out, given the time restraints I had.
      <br>
      My familiarity with animation techniques has also improved much since then.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 250:</strong>
      <br>
      A continuation of skill building in animation and interactive media using Adobe Animate and javascript.

      <strong>GIMM 270:</strong>
      <br>
      This class taught us how to do basic video editing in Adobe Premiere.
      <br>
      Topics included greenscreening, stitching, and 360 video.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 280:</strong>
      <br>
      280 was a class where we learned about mechanical electronics, how to use motors and electrical switches.
      <br>
      We also had some projects that were able to be connected to the computer and controled with digital input.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 290:</strong>
      <br>
      290 taught us better ways to structure game design, and how to plan out a large-scale game project.
      <br>
      We also leared skills with the Unity 3D program, and how to code in C# for Unity.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 300:</strong>
      <br>
      300 is our web design class.  We overviewed HTML programming, as well as CSS and javascript for web design.
      <br>
      This site started development in this class.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 310:</strong>
      <br>
      310 is a mobile app design class.  Our class group, or "cohort", was the first to work exclusively with iOS for this course, using the XCode program to learn the Swift programming language.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 330:</strong>
      <br>
      330 taught us techniques for designing 3D models.  We used Maya from AutoDesk to create a low-poly model and apply basic animation to it.
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 350:</strong>
      <br>
      350 was an advanced game design class, with more advanced skills in the Unity engine, and technical aspects of game design.
      <br>
      We learned how to create states for individual levels or stages, multiplayer functionality over a network, and how to implement Oculus Rift controls into our projects.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 360:</strong>
      <br>
      This class was all about editing audio and manipulating sound files.
      <br>
      We used a program called VCV Rack, which emulates a synthesizer.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 370:</strong>
      <br>
      This class is a continuation of 330, with more advanced modeling techniques.
      <br>
      The end goal for this class is to create a high-poly model with much better levels of detail.
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 400:</strong>
      <br>
      In this class, we learned the basics of machine learning, and how to code basic learning systems in Python.
      <br>
      I created a simple game where you must collect the cubes, while the enemy characters chase you and deplete your health bar upon contact.

      <strong>GIMM 440:</strong>
      <br>
      This class was meant to assist in the creation of a portfolio for my career.
      <br>
      This website was improved to be used for this purpose.
      <br>
      <br>
      <strong>GIMM 480:</strong>
      <br>
      An assignment to create an Augmented Reality application for the Idaho State Penitentiary started in this class.
      <br>
      I created a 3D model of a globe of Earth, and a terrain map of the Chosin Reservoir, where a battle took place during the Korean War.

      <strong>GIMM 490:</strong>
      <br>
      Continued work on the Augmented Reality application for the Idaho State Penitentiary was finished here.
      <br>
      I also improved my skills in 3D modeling with Blender.
